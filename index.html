        <h5 class="mb-3 text-center text-md-left"><b>MuteBot</b></h5>
        <p class="mb-5">In summer 2020, neck deep in a global pandemic, a plucky indie game called Among Us exploded in popularity. As my group of friends and I starting playing the game, we realized muting and unmuting players is an integral and inconvenient part of the game. After our realization, I scoured the internet for a simple Discord bot that could perform a server mute and unmute. I was unable to find a such a bot, so like any decent Computer Science student I decided to make my own. MuteBot is a lightweight Node.js/Discord.js bot that mutes and unmutes everyone on the channel on command. No other fluff necessary! Note: GitHub repository is not yet public.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-3 text-center text-md-left"><a href="https://github.com/pranavmreddy/BellwetherPythonSide"
            target="_blank"><b>Bellwether</b></a></h5>
        <p class="mb-5">Bellwether is a Reddit bot built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and the Python Reddit API. It queries reddit.com/r/stocks and performs sentiment analysis on stocks mentions. It then rates these stock mentions by the number of upvotes its post has and stores this data in a MySQL database. I originally created Bellwether as a way to learn Node.js and sentiment analysis in Python. In light of my recent work experience, I plan on using this project to create an automated trading system that operates on subjective stock mentions from news websites. Follow this webpage or contact me for updates.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-3 text-center text-md-left"><a href="https://github.com/pranavmreddy/pranav.codes" target="_blank"><b>This Website!</b></a></h5>
        <p>The website you are visiting right now is one of my projects! It's a simple portfolio website that I made using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. One of my main goals when building this website was to make it fully mobile responsive (i.e. make it change alignment, spacing, and text size based on the screen size of the device on which it is displayed). Feel free to try this website out on both a smartphone and a computer to see how it changes!</p>
